# Lucky's Table

This repository holds source files for the game [Lucky's Table](https://tjm35.itch.io/luckys-table), submitted to Ludum Dare 49 Compo.

This repository does *not* contain all files required to build the game; paid assets have been omitted, along with some files too large for the version control system. Specifically, to build the game you will need to own and import:

- [All in 1 Sprite Shader](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/all-in-1-sprite-shader-156513)
- [FMod for Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/fmod-for-unity-161631)

The source FModStudio project has been omitted due to file sizes; the project settings will need to be modified to use the included bank files directly instead.
